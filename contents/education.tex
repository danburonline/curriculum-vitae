\section{Education}

\educationentry{King’s College London}{London, United Kingdom}{Master of Science in Applied Neuroscience}{2023 – 2024}{
  \item \textbf{Graduated with distinction}, demonstrating advanced knowledge and research skills in applied neuroscience, integrating both theoretical and practical interests in neuroengineering; my research focus combined the analysis of \textit{in vitro} brain organoids and \textit{in silico} computational brain models with practical applications in neural tissue engineering and bioprinting.
  \item \textbf{Thesis:} My synoptic research project developed a preliminary proof of concept for a neuroimaging-guided pipeline for automatic reconstruction of patient-specific brain geometries into 3D-bioprintable scaffolds, enabling personalised neural tissue replication for progressive brain replacement (precursor work for my company). Thesis title: \textit{Neuroimaging-Guided Pipeline for Automatic Reconstruction of Patient-Specific Brain Geometries into 3D-Bioprintable Scaffolds}
  \item \textbf{Key Courses:} Brain-computer interfacing and neuromodulation, neural tissue engineering, advanced synoptic project (research proposal), biological foundations of neuroscience, research techniques in neuroscience, psychological foundations of neuroscience, mental health in the community, contemporary advances in neuroscience, neurodevelopmental disorders, critical analysis of research ethics, neuroimaging, psychology and neuroscience of psychosis, brain organoids, meta-research and quantitative analysis for neuroscientific studies

\educationentry{Middlesex University London}{Zürich, Switzerland}{Bachelor of Science in Web Development}{2018 – 2022}{
  \item \textbf{Graduated with First Class Honours} (Summa Cum Laude) from a broad and technical curriculum, demonstrating excellence in both full-stack development and advanced web engineering. My cross-disciplinary research during this period focused on simulation software, fault-tolerant cloud systems, 3D/graphics programming, and bidirectional non-invasive brain-computer interfaces.
  \item \textbf{Thesis:} My bachelor’s thesis examined the feasibility of enabling general applicability for brain-computer interface software through cloud computing and defined a novel paradigm for brain-computer interfaces called Neural/Cloud Interface (N/CI), which was crucial for my role at IDUN Technologies and served as a foundation for my Master’s studies in applied neuroscience. Thesis title: \textit{Enabling General Applicability for Brain-Computer Interface Software Through Cloud Computing}
  \item \textbf{Key Courses:} Asynchronous architectures, API design, backend development, software security, server security, databases, web engineering, frontend development, JavaScript/TypeScript, Angular/React.js, 3D simulations and real-time web-based physics (Ammo.js and Rapier), WebGL and Three.js, web animations (2D and 3D), user experience research, testing and design.

\educationentry{School of Design Bern and Biel}{Bern, Switzerland}{Federal Diploma in Interactive Media Design}{2015 – 2017}{
  \item \textbf{Graduated with top-class grades}, ranking among the top performers nationwide, specialising in research-driven, user-centred design methodologies for interactive applications.
  \item Developed a strong foundation in user experience principles and human-computer interactions, sparking an interest in the intersection of technology, human perception, and cognition — ultimately leading to my pursuit of web-based software development and, later on, brain-computer interfaces and neuroscience.
