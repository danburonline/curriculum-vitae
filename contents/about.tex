Interdisciplinary \textbf{neuroengineer developing augmented progressive brain replacement} — a radical procedure for treating neurodegeneration, brain injuries, and ageing through patient-specific neural grafts designed for piece-wise replacement and neuronal-level modulation. \textbf{I lead Eightsix Science, an applied neuroscience startup} I founded, to combine neural tissue engineering, biohybrid brain-computer interfaces, and microsurgery to seamlessly integrate these optimised grafts with the host’s brain. Ultimately, \textbf{we aim to achieve ectopic cognitive preservation}, an approach to sustain cognition outside its original biological context and potentially within virtual reality.

Building on a \textbf{background in wetware computing, brain-computer interfaces, and computational neuroscience}, I have contributed to projects ranging from whole-brain simulations at the Blue Brain Project to closed-loop control of virtual avatars using human brain organoids at FinalSpark.

I bring rigorously systematic and holistic \textbf{strategies to overcoming ageing as a disease} and pushing the boundaries of neurotechnology. Fundamentally, I treat death as an engineering challenge to be solved and aspire to \textbf{research better substrates for synthetic consciousness} in the long run.
